### Installing ROS 2 Jazzy

Follow the <a href=https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html target="_blank">official ROS 2 Jazzy instructions</a>
to install ROS 2 from deb packages.
This documentation uses `ros-jazzy-desktop`.

### Installing Tobas

Install Tobas from the ROS 2 apt repository.

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install ros-jazzy-tobas
```

In each terminal where you use Tobas, source the ROS 2 Jazzy environment.

```bash
$ source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
```

### Requirements

- <a href=https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/ target="_blank">Raspberry Pi 5 (2 GB or more)</a>
- Tobas HAT <!-- TODO: URL -->
- A microSD card with at least 16 GB of storage (e.g., <a href=https://www.sandisk.com/products/memory-cards/microsd-cards/sandisk-extreme-uhs-i-microsd target="_blank">SanDisk Extreme microSDXC™ UHS-I CARD - 32GB</a>)
- An SD card reader (e.g., <a href=https://www.sandisk.com/products/accessories/memory-card-readers/sandisk-quickflow-microsd-memory-card-reader-usb-c target="_blank">SANDISK QuickFlow microSD Card Reader with USB-C</a>)

### Procedure

Install a suitable image flashing tool. For example, you can use one of the following:
